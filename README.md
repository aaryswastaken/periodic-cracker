# ✨ Periodic cracker ✨

*By @aaryswastaken*

---

A simple script to bruteforce the search of a set of word into a new dictionnary, checking for special conditions.

Here being used to brute-force a password that has a known numeric and alphabetica length, corresponding to either a 
French or an english word, converted using the periodic table 

*Note: You can see the hard coded start sequence of "Cr" to drastically speed things up (from 852,815 to 220)*

Mainly for entertainment purpose tho
